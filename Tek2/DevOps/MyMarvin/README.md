![Badge Mark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module%20Mark-A-%2372FA08.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logoColor=black)

## Overview

The project was entirely evaluated with Automated Tests. Marvin evaluating your Marvin, does not that
sound nice? Automatically testing via an automation platform the automatic configuration of an automation platform. . . thanks DevOps! ;)

Throughout this project, we had to use [Configuration as Code (a.k.a. JCasC)](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/), which allows us to describe our
entire desired Jenkins configuration in just a single YAML file.

## Opinion

A difficult project cause it is based on an Jenkin's extention not very documented but 100% tests passed so good :).
