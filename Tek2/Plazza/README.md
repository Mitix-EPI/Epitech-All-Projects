## Overview

The goal of this project is to recreate a automatic pizza restaurant where anyone can order differents type of pizzas. The restaurnat must be responsive and must adapt to the demand. Each kitchen is represented by **Thread Pool** and every employees in there are individual **Thread** who can handle and make 2 pizzas maximum (with one waiting for the other).

We had to handle **Thread pools**, differents **processes** and the managment of the **ingredients**.

## How to use

```bash
> make
> ./plazza 2 3 1000
```

## Bonus

We created a bonus where you can order pizzas with UI programmed with SFML. Enjoy it !

## Opinion
