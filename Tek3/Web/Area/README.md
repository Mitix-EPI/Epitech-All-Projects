- A Web App that will be used by the users to interact with the software suite.

- A mobile app that will be used by the users to interact with the software suite.

## Languages

This project was developped using the following languages:

- Server: Python -> FastAPI
- Web App: TypeScript -> Angular
- Mobile App: TypeScript -> Angular
- Database: MySQL
