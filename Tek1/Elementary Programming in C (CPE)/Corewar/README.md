# Corewar

![Badge Mark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module%20Mark-B-%23B1FA08.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logoColor=black)

## Overview

The Corewar project is to create an Assembly Compiler and also a Virtual Machine (VM). The goal is to write in assembly code some champions, from the 1984's Corewar Game, which will be launch in the VM and would fight in them.

I really apreciate to work on this huge project ! I learnt a lot of things about the basics of how a PC works ! Verry difficult to understand the subject because Epitech gives us more than 20 pages of subjects.

We almost have a Module Mark A but we had 3 coding style mistakes :sweat:.

## Bonus

We created a real interface developped in Ncurses where you can see the head of each champions executing all the instructions of the arena.
