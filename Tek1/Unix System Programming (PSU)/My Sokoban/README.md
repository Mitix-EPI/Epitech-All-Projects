# My Sokoban

![Badge Mark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module%20Mark-B-%23B1FA08.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logoColor=black)

## Overview

The Sokoban project was our first project in nCurses and I had fun to recreate a sokoban game.

I did not have a A module mark because my printf wasn't enough complete.
