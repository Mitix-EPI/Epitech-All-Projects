#### Graphical projects

*All graphical projects are developped in C with the CSFML graphical library.*

*The projects are sorted from the first to the last.*

| Projects Names | Descriptions | Duration (days) |
|     :---:      |    :---:    |      :---:      |
| [My Hunter] | Reproduce [Duck Hunt] game :duck::gun:. Scores, target, ennemies and progressive difficulty are implemented in the game. I also add my touch of fun by adding references to [JUL], the famous french rapper. The game is very fun to play. Many people in the promotion tried to beat their scores ! | :two::four: |
| [My Runner] | Create a video game based on the rules of a finite [Endless Running Game]:running:. The game has a character running with animation. [Parallax] is present in the background. The player can jump to avoid obstacles. The player can also custom his level editing a txt file. The level design is about the ninjas ! :anger::martial_arts_uniform: | :two::six: |
| [My Defender] | Create a [Tower Defense] game :european_castle:. The player is a builder who must defend his castle. Ennemy waves regularly appear from (at least) one side of the playground. The player can buy, place buildings, and upgrade its to kill ennemies ! The player earns money when a turret kills an ennemy. There are 100 rounds in one map ! And there are 3 completely differents maps (spawns, ennemies paths)! :scream: The game is fully responsive and has differents sizes of window !  | :two::eight: |
| [My RPG] | Create a [RPG Game] ! We had carte blanche ! So we created an entire universe around the COVID epidemic :mask: with the main character who want to join his girlfriend :heart: during the lockdown :no_pedestrians:. The player need to avoid policemen :policeman: and collect items to know where is living his love. In battle, the player has compentencies. There is a system of experiences and difficulties which upgrade the character and the ennemies. At the end, the adventurer have to kill the COVID-19 virus. After the end of the project, we continued to develop our game. Indeed, the game is disponible in Windows, Mac and Linux ! You can download it directly on his website :arrow_right: [sidona.ml] ! :star2: | :four::nine: |

#### Mathematical projects

:warning: *Collaborations README are coming* :warning:

*All mathematical projects can be developped in all language. I choose to program in Python :snake:*

*The projects are sorted from the first to the last.*

| Projects Names | Quick Description | Has bonus |
|      :---:     |         :---:     |    :---:  |
| [101 Pong] | Program which calcs the velocity vector of the [Pong] ball, the ball coordinates in `t + n` and his incidence angle. *BONUS: Real pong game with pygame lib* | :star: |
| [102 Architect] | Program to compute the coordinates of a point after several transformations. Translation, scaling, rotation contered at 0, reflection over any axis that passes through 0 are the transformations possible (utilization of matrix). | |
| [103 Cipher] | Creation of a program which encrypts or decrypts messages with key with imposed standard: Converting the key to a square matrix, Converting the message into a matrix, Multiply both matrices :arrow_right: encrypted message. *BONUS: Tkinter window that shows differents types of encryption and decryption* | :star: |
| [104 Intersection] | Calcs intersection points between light rays and scene objects (cylenders of revolution around `Z` axis, `0`-centered spheres and cones of revolution around `Z` axis whose apex is `0`). | |
| [105 Torus] | Solve a 4th degree equation ![equation 4th degree] with three differents iteratives algorithms: [The bisection method], [The Newton's method] and [The secant method]. | |

| Projects Names | Module | Language(s) | Description |
|      :---:     |  :---: |    :---:    |    :---:    |
| [N4S] | Introduction to A.I. | C | Build an Intelligence Artificial to drive a car in any `CoppeliaSim Edu` map with obstacles thanks to the `CoppeliaSim` API|
| [EpyTodo] | Introduction to WEB | Pythons / HTML / CSS / Javascript / SQL | Create Front and Back website with Database storage with mySQL and Web Server (Flask). The server implements a MVC architecture. An API is created to securely :lock: connect the website and the database. EpyTodo is a website where you're able to handle all the tasks you need to do easily. I'm very proud of this project because it was my first time I develop a website and the result (UX and how it works) is very impressive !|
